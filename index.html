            <h2>Why Clean Air Matters</h2>
            <p>
                We share the air with everyone around us.  When someone sick
                exhales, talks, coughs, or sneezes, they release tiny
                infectious particles that can float in the air for hours.  The
                COVID-19 pandemic showed us that airborne transmission is a
                major route for disease spread, but it's not just COVID: colds,
                flu, and many other diseases also spread through the air.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ventilation and air purifiers are two great tools, but they're
                not the best fit for every situation.  Ventilation systems
                usually don't remove dirty air fast enough, and are expensive
                to expand.  Air purifiers work well when used as designed, but
                people often run them on low or leave them off because of how
                much noise the fans produce.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>We need a solution that continuously cleans the air
                we're breathing, without expensive retrofits or noisy fans.

            <h2>Why Far-UVC</h2>
            <p>
                Far-UVC technology offers a promising solution to these
                challenges.  It is a kind of light that continuously
                inactivates viruses and bacteria in the air and on surfaces.
                It's quick to install, and nearly silent.

            <p>
                The practical impact can be substantial: fewer students absent
                from schools, reduced hospital-acquired infections, and more
                consistent workplace productivity during cold and flu
                season. But how can a kind of light accomplish all this?
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="how">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                Ultraviolet (UV) light spans a range of wavelengths, and the
                effect on viruses, bacteria, and the human body depends very
                strongly on where we're talking about within that range.  While
                some kinds of UV are dangerous for humans, the specific range
                we're discussing here is the much safer "far-UVC".
            </p>
            <p>
                Far-UVC's strongest effect on viruses and bacteria is to damage
                their proteins, so they can't infect us. This same protein
                absorption is what makes far-UVC safe for our skin: unlike the
                UVA and UVB in sunlight that penetrate deep enough to cause
                lasting damage, far-UVC is so strongly absorbed by proteins in
                the dead outer layers of our skin that it doesn't reach the
                living cells beneath.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="gorlitz-figure-4.jpg">
            <i>Figure 4
                from <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/php.13866">Görlitz
                et al. (2023)</a>, illustrating how little far-UVC (~222nm)
                penetrates outer layers of dead skin.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Our eyes, however, don't have the same protection from a series
                of dead outer layers.  Instead, they're protected by a
                combination of natural physical barriers and biological
                resilience.  Our eyebrows, eyelids, lashes, and tear film all
                help reduce the fraction of far-UVC that makes it into our
                eyes.  The light that does make it in is absorbed by the
                outermost layers of the cornea, which regenerate rapidly.  It
                is true, however, that eyes are at higher risk from far-UVC
                than skin, and guidelines for exposure limits and lamp
                placement are primarily driven by what levels are safe for
                eyes.

                et al. (2023)</a> reviewed the risks and benefits of far-UVC
                and concluded that "current evidence supports using far-UVC
                systems within existing
                guidelines."  <a href="#research">Multiple studies</a> have
                not found evidence of skin or eye damage, even at much higher
                levels than are needed for air cleaning.

        <section id="deploy">
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>
                 Far-UVC is most valuable in crowded indoor spaces where people
                 spend extended time together.  Because it is based on light,
                 it also has the strongest advantages over alternative methods
                 like air purifiers in larger rooms, where beams of light can
                 travel further.
            </p>

            <p>
                 When looking for a far-UVC lamp, you need to be cautious:
                 there are a lot of poor quality products, and even some that
                 put out dangerous longer wavelengths.  Low-quality bulbs that
                 have stopped producing far-UVC will still glow purple, giving
                 the impression that they're still working.  Look for lamps
                 that have been evaluated
                 by <a href="https://www.osluv.org/">OSLUV</a> and found
                 to <a href="https://reports.osluv.org/">perform as
                 designed</a>, and for bulbs rated for thousands of hours.
            </p>

            <p>
                 Two specific examples to consider are
                 the <a href="https://aerolamp.net/">Aerolamp</a>
                 (<a href="https://reports.osluv.org/static/assay/aerolamp%20devkit--27c4ca60-0da7-4669-8cc7-36746a06fb62--R00.html">evaluation</a>)
                 and
                 the <a href="https://www.nukit222.com/products/torch-far-uvc-lights-set">Nukit
                 Torch</a>
                 (<a href="https://reports.osluv.org/static/assay/nukit%20torch%20r2%203v7--9b03c8ee-745b-467e-a152-e270217ae50b--R00.html">evaluation</a>).
                 The Aerolamp is more expensive, but is built around
                 the <a href="https://www.care222.com/">Ushio Care222 B1</a>.
                 This is
                 a <a href="https://www.ushio.com/files/specifications/care222-filtered-far-uv-c-excimer-lamp-module-technical-data-sheet.pdf">long-lasting
                 design</a>, rated for 10,000 hours.  That's one year of 24/7
                 usage, five years of working hours, or much longer if run less
                 often.
            </p>

            <p>
                 While far-UVC is very safe, make sure to install your lamp
                 following the manufacturer's instructions.  Well-filtered
                 222nm lamps produce minimal amounts of ozone, so manufacturers
                 often recommend using an air purifier with an activated carbon
                 filter as an added precaution. If you're setting up multiple
                 lamps to cover the same area we recommend OSLUV's modeling
                 tool <a href="https://illuminate.osluv.org/">Illuminate</a> to
                 ensure your lamp placement stays within
